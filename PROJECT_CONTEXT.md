# Mini Time Clock Context

## Product Summary

This project is a small offline time clock app built with Flutter. The first target is Android, but the code should stay ready for iOS by avoiding platform-specific native code when possible.

The app does not track clock-in or clock-out times. It only stores whether the user worked in each half of the current day:

- Before lunch
- After lunch

Each period is saved as a boolean value. The user can edit only the current day until 23:59.

## Main Rules

- The app must work offline with a local database.
- A day can have two saved values: `worked_before_lunch` and `worked_after_lunch`.
- The default state for each period is `false`.
- The main screen shows two large buttons.
- A light gray button means the period is not marked.
- A red button means the period is marked as worked.
- Tapping a button toggles the value and autosaves it.
- Old days are read-only.
- Future days cannot be edited.
- The edit rule is centralized in `WorkDayEditPolicy`.

## Configuration

The app needs a settings screen where the user can define the value of a half day worked.

Example:

```text
Half day value: R$ 80,00
```

This value is used in the monthly report. In code and database records, store it as cents (`half_day_value_cents`) to avoid decimal rounding errors. If both periods are marked in one day, the day total is two times the half day value.

## Local Data Model

Suggested tables:

```text
work_day
  id
  date
  worked_before_lunch
  worked_after_lunch
  created_at
  updated_at

settings
  id
  half_day_value_cents
  updated_at
```

## Screens

### Home

Shows the current date and two large autosave buttons:

- Before lunch
- After lunch

### Search

Allows searching saved work days by date or month. It shows only saved records and their two period values.

### Settings

Allows editing and saving the half day value in local storage.

### Monthly Report

Shows only dates with at least one marked period. Empty days should not appear.

Clean report example:

```text
Monthly Report
June/2026

Date        Before   After    Value
16/06/2026  Yes      No       R$ 80,00
17/06/2026  Yes      Yes      R$ 160,00

Summary
Worked days: 2
Periods: 3
Total: R$ 240,00
```

PDF is the preferred first export format because it is simple to share, print, and keep consistent across Android and iOS.

## Story Plan

Each story should use its own branch. Branch names and commit messages must be in simple English.

1. `story/create-flutter-android` - create the Flutter project with Android focus.
2. `story/create-local-database` - add the local database and work day table.
3. `story/create-settings-value` - save the half day value.
4. `story/create-home-buttons` - add the main screen with two large autosave buttons.
5. `story/lock-old-days` - block editing outside the current day.
6. `story/create-settings-screen` - add the settings screen.
7. `story/create-search-screen` - search by date or month.
8. `story/create-month-report` - show only marked days in the monthly report.
9. `story/add-money-total` - calculate the monthly money total.
10. `story/create-report-pdf` - generate a clean monthly PDF.
11. `story/share-report-pdf` - view or share the generated PDF.

## Git Workflow

- Use one branch per story.
- Use branch names like `story/create-home-buttons`.
- Use Conventional Commits with a scope, for example:
  - `feat(home): add period buttons`
  - `fix(report): hide empty days`
  - `docs(context): add project rules`
- Keep commits small and clear.
- If a defect needs a formal correction flow, open an issue, fix it in a branch, and close the issue in the commit or pull request.
